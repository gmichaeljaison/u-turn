u-turn
======

A simple two-player line game in a CPP program.

In a single screen, two-players will start the game at the same time. Initially, both players will be allocated with specific color-coded line that starts from left and right respectively. The player should make sure that they do not collide in the wall or other player's line in order to stay in the game. And the one who stays for a longer period wins the game :)
